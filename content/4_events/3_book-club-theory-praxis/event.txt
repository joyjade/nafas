Title: Book Club: Theory & Praxis

----

Description:

Nafas will host poet and activist-scholar Nat Raha, who is visiting from Edinburgh, Scotland, with poet Willa Smart. The authors will present readings of recent work before joining in conversation about trans writing and life.

What actions / poetics / dialogues do we need for this phase of global backlash against trans and gender non-conforming people? Poetic offerings will inspire a discussion encompassing trans care, abolitionist ethics, politics of fantasy, trans femme futures, and more.
